##Setup
To avoid the cross domain policy issues that prevent the application to be seen in local you do not need to run it on a local server like node.js. Perhaps a quicker solution is to do the following:

- on Firefox, enter "about:config" in the URL 
- set the "flag security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy" to false
- enjoy!
